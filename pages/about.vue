      ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul - a UX Designer and Front End Developer from Liverpool and now based
      in Oxford.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="pb-5">My journey to this point has been full of twists and turns...</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">
      My background is originally in Biochemistry and Biological Science. I did a Masters
      degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and that was my way in to
      development. I delved into the web making a website for my band on Geocities! It was
      hilariously basic. The website, not the band.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-4">
      I've been a Java backend developer for a pharmaceutical company, a front end dev for
      a graduate careers site, a webmaster for University of Oxford, built interfaces for
      computational chemistry apps, Laravel dev and voiceover artist(!) for a digital
      agency. You name it, I've done it. Within reason.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-4">
      My UX journey started around 10 years ago when I first opened Balsamiq Mockups and
      made a mockup of the plan for the SGC website. Since then, I've learned about
      interaction design, psychology, compromise, diplomacy, and accessibility. I really
      love being able to combine the design and dev worlds, and learning how each
      influences the other.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-4">
      When Iâ€™m not doing UX things, I enjoy playing drums and guitar and have turned my
      drumming practice into my exercise - you can see what I mean at
      <NuxtLink to="http://metalwerkout.com">metalwerkout.com</NuxtLink>. I also like
      gardening and woodwork, and have to endure the fortunes (or lack of them) of Everton
      Football Club (Thanks, Dad!). I have a little girl who takes up the vast majority of
      this free time instead at the moment!
