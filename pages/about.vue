    <h1 class="pb-4">About me</h1>
    <h2 class="pb-5">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Paul - a UX Designer and Front End Developer based in Oxford. Iâ€™m from Liverpool originally though.</h2>
    <p class="pb-4">I have most recently been UI Engineer at evaluagent and have worn quite a few hats - UX design, interaction design, wireframing and prototyping, UX research and reporting directly to stakeholders as well as evangelising for UX in more aspects of the business. Add to that getting my hands dirty with VueJS and design systems and you can see Iâ€™ve worked right across the web ecosystem.</p>
    <p>When Iâ€™m not doing UX things, I enjoy playing drums and guitar and have turned my drumming practice into my exercise - you can see what I mean at <NuxtLink to="http://metalwerkout.com">metalwerkout.com</NuxtLink>. I also like gardening and woodwork, and have to endure the fortunes (or lack of them) of Everton Football Club. Thanks Dad!</p>
